This file contains the code used to visualize the data collected(news articles scraped).<br>

- The first plot in the code shows the imbalance across various categories of data. The number of regular articles in our dataset is much
more than editorials. This suggests that we need to either downsample the regular articles or upsample the editorials.
- The second plot shows a plot of the number of words in articles across all sources. This plot is used while preprocessing data to 
remove articles that are either too short or too long. Very few articles were more than 2000 words long.
- The third plot has subplots with each subplot showing the distribution of word count for each news source in the dataset. Since the
second plot had a word count range between 0 and 16000 words, this plot was used to figure out which news source had the tendency of
publishing lengthy articles. As can be seen in the plot, New York Times generally publishes articles which are longer than the median
word count obtained in the previous plot.
