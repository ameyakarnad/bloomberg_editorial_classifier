Chart type 1:
Visualising the top authors contributing to the regular type of articles across sources. We try to visualise who are the top authors contributing to the articles of regular type here.

Chart type 3:
Visualising the top authors contributing to the non-regular type of articles across sources. We try to visualise who are the top authors contributing to the articles of non-regular type here.

Chart type 4:
We try to visualise which newspapers are the top contributors for:
1. Regular stories
2. Editorial articles
3. Opinion articles
4. Op-Ed articles
5. Guest articles
Next we try to visualise the top authors for that contributing source. This can help us determine whether some authors focus only on a specific category of articles. We can also use their writing style while training our model.
